# Template of University Database
 
</div>

I remade a template that contains the original data from db-book.com to insert easily for students. This University database with tables and rows inserted scripts , will allow you to test exercise from database book.  Just need to download this scripts and run at your own MySQL workbench, use it wisely.

# <h3>Usage</h3>

1. Clone the whole repo or a single file as you wish.
2. Open the sql script in your mysql work bench
3. Run Create_Template.sql first and then Insert_Template.sql
   (if you haven't already created university database , you can remove the drop database line in create)
4. Here we go , now you have univerisity databases tables including example datas to test
